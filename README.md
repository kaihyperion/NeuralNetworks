Implemented PyTorch
Learned aobut the impact of different hyper-parameters on networks' performance
2 types of neural networks

training model on training dataset on one epoch

evaluating trained model on a validation set

training over multiple epoch and validate and testing on a model
2 fully connected neural networks
